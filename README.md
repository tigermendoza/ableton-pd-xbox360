# ableton-pd-xbox360

Introduction

This is my attempt at creating an interface so that I can use an Xbox 360 control pad with Ableton Live. I created similar interfaces with Glove PIE before but as that program is no longer being developed and doesn't work with Windows 8, I thought I would see if I could create a new version using Pure Data (http://puredata.info/). Pure Data also has the benefits of being cross platform compatible, and therefore should allow people to use the same interface with Mac OSX and Linux based set ups.

Note: So far I have only tested this set up on a x64, Windows 8.1 based system running Ableton 9 suite. It *should* work fine on similar set ups I haven't been able to test it on any other machines yet so no guarantees.

Required software:

Pure Data extended: http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended

Ableton Live: https://www.ableton.com/en/live/

loopMIDI: http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
(or similar virtual midi software)

Required hardware:

Xbox 360 control pad (wired or wireless)

Wireless Gaming Receiver For Windows (if you're using a wireless pad obviously)

Computer running Windows 8.

FAQs

Q: Why use an Xbox 360 control pad with Ableton?

A: The 2 analogue thumbsticks and multiple buttons and triggers allow for a lot of controling options which therefore works well with Ableton Live's mapability. So why not?
